# Hi, welcome to OceanHackWeek

We are making plans for OceanHackWeek 2023. While there are many decisions to be made, it will likely take place in August 2023 in a hybrid form with one in-person event and a global virtual event. Visit us again in April 2023 for updates! In the meantime, you can learn more about OceanHackWeek by browsing our web site ([https://oceanhackweek.org](https://oceanhackweek.org)), including [last year's event, OHW22](https://oceanhackweek.org/ohw22/); and [contact us](https://oceanhackweek.org/about/contact.html) if you're interested in helping out.

## About OceanHackWeek

[OceanHackWeek (OHW)](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/about/index) is a 5-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring,
creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for
large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking.
Its objectives are to:
				
- Promote data and software proficiency in ocean scientists: Provide participants with computational and data science skills that can advance oceanography research, which often requires the integration and manipulation of diverse sources of data and models.
- Facilitate inclusive community building: Connect oceanographers across disciplines and career stages and cultivate an open science and a sharing culture.
